# 1. Specify Functional and non-functional requirements for given Library Information System system.
## Functional Requirements:
    1.Members can borrow a book or return it.
    2.It should be restricted to only members of the corresponding institue of returning and issuing of books.
    3.Searching and browsing books should be freely available for any outside person or non-member.
    4.Librarian can able to enter a new record and remove existing record of books.
    5.Librarian staff must be able to maintaion day to day book transactions.
    6.The functionality of Authentication of user should be there whenever the person do the login activity.
    7.Whenever a member registers for the first time or sign up, A verification mail should be sent to the user.
    8.Security of the software or web application should be taken care of.      
    9.Allowing a member to prolong the duration of his borrowing if no other booking have been made for that specific book.    
    
## Non-Functional Requirements:
    1.The software or website should be able to handle a large number of users without affecting the performance.
    2.It should have user-friendly interface for the ease of use.
    3.The system should only run within Institute LAN for security reasons, also personal details of every user should be stored in encrypted form in the database.
    4.Any confidential information(e.g., passwords) must not be stored as plain text.
    5.System needs to be scalable to accommodate institute's growth.
    6.The processing of each request should be done within less time.
    7.System should be compatible with every browser and OS and it should be portable, so moving from one OS to sanother OS does not cause any problem.
    8.The web application must be developed using latest HTML 5.


# 2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

# Scope:
We are creating an android application for people who suffer from disabling hearing loss using an Artificial Intelligence software which recognises basic key sounds such as vehicle sounds and someone crying for help and gives immediate alerts via vibration to the users and it must have low latency so that it can be used anywhere and the predictions of the AI must be Accurate.

# Features:
- When a critical emergency is recognised and there is no reaction from the user, notify friends and family.
- Low latency to enable real-time use.
- The app uses less power and have low latency for extended use.
- The sounds recorded must also be logged properly in readable format.
- It uses Artificial Intelligence to recognise basic key sounds events of interest to the community such as car sounds and babies.
- The app should run in the background also.

# Non-Functional Aspects:
- When travelling, the app should be able to recommend the lanes with the least amount of traffic.
- Users should be able to send their current position to friends and relatives in case of an emergency via the app.
- The latency of the app should be at most 2 seconds.
- The software must be logging continuously so that an immediate alert can be sent.
- The app should be able to track the live location of users that can be sent to friends and family in emergency situations.
- The App should alert the user through some vibrations.
